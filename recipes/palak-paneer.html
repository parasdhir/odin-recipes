    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent Paneer cubes (Indian cottage cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share two ways to make this healthy dish a homestyle version and a restaurant style version with a charcoal smoking method</p>
    <p>This deliciously creamy and vibrantly green dish is made with paneer in a mildly spiced fresh spinach sauce. This is a delightful and easy to make vegetarian main you just have to try!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 pound paneer, cubes</li>
